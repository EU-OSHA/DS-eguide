\par \pard \ql {\fs24 1. Special requirements for certain chemical products and substances\line \line 1.1. Introduction\line \line \line \line Specific measures are often needed when working with certain chemical products or substances.\line \line \line Applying good practice is often an easy, fast and effective way of complying with the general regulatory demands for safe handling of chemicals.\uc0{\u160} The good practice includes tips and advice on measures that reduce and control risks.\line \line \line There are, of course, many more products and substances which may pose risks. For all chemical products as well as for substances generated from different processes, the general regulations about risk assessment and measures to control the chemical risks apply. Read more about that under the section These routines must work. The action to be taken depends on how the risk is assessed a.\line \line \line This guide informs on different types of practical measures to reduce chemical risks. There is a comprehensive body of European and national legislation for these and more substances that present specific demands for these as well as other substances.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 1.2. Carcinogenic and mutagenic substances\line \line \line \line Substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic give rise to serious risks, which usually are not immediately noticeable when in contact with the substance, but which may result in serious effects in the form of cancer after several years, or which may harm the next generation, by their impact on reproductive performance, foetus or genetic damage. \b Carcinogenic and mutagenic substances shall not be used, if not absolutely necessary\b0 .\line \line \line \line \line Where it is possible, it is compulsory to replace those chemical products which are labelled with\line \line \line 	R45: May cause cancer\line 	H350: May cause cancer\line 	R49: May cause cancer by inhalation\line 	R46: May cause heritable genetic damage\line 	H340: May cause genetic defects\line 	H360: May damage fertility or the unborn child\line 	Exception: This does not apply to fuels used in vehicles, engines or heating.\line \line \line \line \b Is it possible to replace the carcinogenic and mutagenic product?\b0 \line \line In order to be able to assess whether it is possible to replace a chemical product which contains carcinogenic and mutagenic substances and there is a need to examine this issue further. Use the method described in the e-tool to investigate this.\line \line \uc0{\u160}\line \line \b Measures\b0 \line \line \line \line If carcinogenic and mutagenic substances cannot be replaced, it can be good to keep documentation on the investigation which shows that it is not technically feasible to use other less hazardous chemical products.\line \line \line \line \line In the event that products containing carcinogenic and mutagenic substances must be used, they shall (if technically possible) be handled in a closed system. Work, including the equipment and working methods are designed so as to create as little air contaminants as possible and so that sprinkling and splashing is prevented.\line \line \line \line \line The air contaminants generated shall be captured as quickly and as effective as possible and as close as possible to the source using process ventilation, e.g. local exhausts.\line \line \line \line \line If there is a risk of contact with skin, personal protective equipment in the form of protective clothing and protective gloves shall be used.\line \line \line \line \line Spillages shall be collected and removed as quickly and as safely as possible. Wastes which may contain such substances must be stored and transported in shock-resistant, sealed and labelled containers.\line \line \line \line \line For work with carcinogenic or reprotoxic substances, it can be good to provide a written working and safety instruction in order to make it very clear what routines need to be followed.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 1.3. Risk assessment\line \line \line \line If carcinogenic and mutagenic substances are present, it is necessary to assess the risks posed by them. The simplest is, of course, if the products can be replaced with other less dangerous products, in which case there is no need for such an extended the risk assessment which must be carried out for these substances. If this is not possible to replaces these, an assessment should be carry out, which shall include:\line \line Where the substances may occur.\line \line What measures are to be taken and how the work is organised in order to secure that only those working with these substances are present in the premises and rooms where these substances are handled\line \line The protective measures\line \line Where personal protection is needed, where it is intended to be used and the type of protective equipment to be used.\line \line How to secure that everything is working fine, such as technical measures, work instructions are complied with and that changes in or deviations that increase the risk of exposure to the substances are detected as early as possible.\line Such assessments shall be documented and the documentation needs to include the points above.\line \line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 1.4. Register of workers exposed to carcinogenic and mutagenic substances\line \line \line \line \b Carcinogenic and mutagenic\b0  substances can cause serious effects that may appear only after a long period of time. In order to facilitate later investigations into the cause of a cancer or a reproductive abnormality register of exposures is required. The employer is responsible for ensuring that there is such a register. The records shall be retained for a period of at least 40 years (calculated from the date on which the exposure ceases).\line \line \line The exposures are to be included in the register\line \line \line When it is known that workers are exposed to concentrations in excess of the existing occupational exposure limit values.\line \line \line When safeguard measures on a temporary basis have not worked or where existing work instructions are not followed, so that workers are exposed to short-term or long-term high exposure.\line \line \line The register shall cover work with substances which are labelled with the hazard statements or risk phrases:\line \line \line 	R45: May cause cancer.\line 	H350: May cause cancer\line 	R49: May cause cancer by inhalation\line 	R46: May cause heritable genetic damage\line 	H340: May cause genetic defects\line \line \line \line The register must also be kept for, among other things, work with:\line \line \line Wood dust from the wood of deciduous trees.\line \line \line Coal soot, coal tar or coal pitch (containing carcinogenic poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs).\line \line \line The register shall include the following information:\line \line \line Name of the worker\line \line \line Work tasks\line \line \line The worker\uc0{\u8217}s exposure (involving any of the risks described above)\line \line \line How high exposure was. This can be given as a meter (measured exposure), the exposure has been measured. In the absence of measurements, the degree of exposure shall be estimated and described. It can be difficult to make reliable assessments of the exposure. Consult a specialist if needed.\line \line \line The frequency with which the worker was exposed.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 2. Sensitising substances\line \line \line \line Many chemical products contain sensitising substances. Allergies such as asthma or eczema may develop after contact with sensitizing substances. Allergies are lifelong and those having developed an allergy will for the rest of their life react also after contact with very small quantities of the substance. Therefore it is good to apply the following good practice, in order to reduce the risk of developing an allergy.\line \line \line \b Good practice measures\b0 \line \line It is good to have routines and rules describing:\line \line \line \line 	Where to handle the sensitizing product.\line 	What protective measures should be used in order to reduce the exposure as much as practically possible?\line 	Should personal protective equipment be used? What kind of equipment and when?\line 	How shall equipment and ventilation be maintained and controlled so that workers are not exposed for sensitising substances?\line 	If sensitizing products are handled openly, are there warning signs informing about the risk?\line \line \line \line \b Information about the risks and protective measures\b0 \line \line Those working with sensitising chemical products or supervising such work need to be informed about the risks and how to conduct the work as well as what protective measures to apply in order to avoid exposure to the sensitising substances.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 3. Asbestos\line \line 3.1.Introduction\line \line \line \line The following applies to all work with asbestos\line \line \line Working with asbestos requires effective measures that reduce the exposure to asbestos, but also notification, training, medical checks and measurements.\line \line If asbestos must be removed, it is simplest to make use of the services of a contractor for the remediation of asbestos. In order to ensure that the contractor complies with the applicable laws and rules for the removal of asbestos, it is good to be clear about the requirements on the contractor. These requirements can be included in the procurement demands and in agreement with the contractor.\line \line \line 3.2. Measures prior to the commencement of work:\line \line \line \line 	Check that you have made the notification needed, that the workers have the training and medical checks required and that the measurements needed for risk assessments are carried out.\line 	Examine which materials containing or likely to contain asbestos.\line 	For demolition \uc0{\u8212} if there is the slightest doubt as to whether asbestos is present, request information on the presence of asbestos in the building to be demolished, the owner or the owner of the technical device (such as machinery).\line 	Specific arrangements and equipment is needed to work with asbestos safely. Work therefore needs to be planned carefully, so that all necessary arrangements are in place when work starts.\line 	It is important to be prepared to protect staff if something unexpected occurs. Assess risks and describe how the work is to be carried out and the protective equipment to be used in safety instructions; the instructions shall be available at the workplace. In demolition processes the instructions needs to be adapted to the situation at the establishment concerned. The written working and safety instructions shall contain the following information on the measures:\line 	how to prevent dust suppression\line 	the need for personal protective equipment\line 	cleaning up after demolition\line 	handling the waste\line 	personal hygiene.\line \line \line \line 3.3. Organising the work\line \line \line \line Organise the work so that as few workers as possible are in contact with and exposed to asbestos.\line \line Plan the work so that there is time to keep the facilities and equipment clean. Clean up dust containing asbestos fibres continuously. If equipment is to be transported to another location for cleaning \uc0{\u8212} put it in sealed packaging before transport.\line \line Smoking is forbidden within the defined area in which asbestos is present.\line \line \line \b Labelling and signage\b0 \line \line Place of work where asbestos is present and concentrations will probably exceed the threshold limit value must be clearly delimited and clearly marked with warning signs, e.g. \uc0{\u8220}Asbestos work \uc0{\u8212} No access of non-authorised persons\uc0{\u8221} or for demolition; \uc0{\u8220}Caution \uc0{\u8212} Demolition \uc0{\u8212} Asbestos \uc0{\u8212} Access prohibited for unauthorised persons\uc0{\u8217}.\line \line Packaging and containers containing asbestos or materials containing asbestos, shall be clearly marked with warnings which must contain the word \uc0{\u8220}asbestos\uc0{\u8221}.\line \line \line 3.4. Respiratory protection\line \line \line \line Breathing protection shall be chosen so that it fits the user (fit is important in order to have a high level of protection).\line \line The only type of respiratory protective equipment providing protection against asbestos are powered and supplied-air respirators. In exceptional cases filter masks may be used but only if the air does not contain high concentrations of asbestos and the work is not be physically demanding.\b  In practice, the situation is almost always that powered and supplied-air respirator is the only option which secures good enough protection against asbestos.\b0 \line \line \line 3.5. Workwear\line \line \line \line Comprehensive and close-fitting protective clothing incorporating a hood shall be used for all activities, with direct contact with asbestos, for instance in the event of demolition and when working with installations which contain asbestos. The protective clothing needs to be dust repelling and designed in such a way that no dust is collected in the fold, pockets or similar.\line \line Work clothing and personal clothing should not be kept together.\line \line Work clothing contaminated by asbestos should not be allowed to be laundered, together with other garments. (Studies show that asbestos workers families also have an increased incidence of diseases related to exposure to asbestos, which is considered to be due to exposure to asbestos in family members working clothes.)\line \line Containers containing the clothes used when working with asbestos must be clearly marked with the words \uc0{\u8216}asbestos contaminated protective clothing\uc0{\u8217}.\line \line \line 3.6. Waste\line \line \line \line Waste, materials, empty packaging, filters and other material containing asbestos, shall immediately be placed in closed containers and stored so until it can be finally disposed of.\line \line \line 3.7. On completion of the work\line \line \line \line Clean up carefully, so that no dust containing asbestos fibres still present on any surfaces.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 3.9. When working in the cabin of a vehicle or machinery\line \line \line \line When working in a vehicle or machinery cabin, the cabin needs to be fitted with a filter for cleaning supply air from asbestos. Select a prefilter together with a so-called \uc0{\u8216}HEPA filter class H13. The prefilter will reduce the load on the HEPA filter\uc0{\u160} and there is less need for frequent changes of it. Used filters must be discarded as waste, see below.\line \line \line If the work is carried out from a vehicle there needs to be an overpressure in the cabin. Overpressure means that if, for example, a window will open a little, the air will flow from the cabin into the environment. If there is an underpressure in the cabin, air will stream into the cabin, that is to say, the asbestos polluted air will enter into the cabin.\line \line \line \i If the filters that are used to clean the supply air to the cabin are getting loaded, the air flow through the filters will decrease and the risk of accidental leakages of asbestos contaminated air into the cabin increases. Therefore it is important to change filters regularly.\i0 \line \line \line \i If doors or windows into the cabin are opened, contaminated air may flow into the cabin. Personal protective equipment including respiratory protection might be required also if working in a cabin, if such leakages of contaminated air cannot be avoided.\i0 \line \line \line 3.10. Asbestos, the requirement for medical checks\line \line \line \line Exposure to asbestos can cause severe pulmonary disorders and even cancer. Therefore, there is a need for special medical surveillance of workers exposed to asbestos.\line \line \line An individual health record must be kept established in accordance with national laws and/or practices\line \line \line Information and advice must be given to workers regarding any assessment of their health after the end of exposure.\line \line \line 3.11. Control of exposure to asbestos\line \line \line \line Work on asbestos can result in serious injuries. In order to verify how high levels of workerworkers, there are requirements for the assessment of risks, as well as, where appropriate, measurement of air pollution at work with asbestos (limit value is 0,1 fibre/ml).\line \line It is difficult to assess the risks of working with asbestos is exposed to concentrations in excess of the limit value. A rule of thumb is that there is a risk of exceeding the limit value if no action is taken, and no breathing protection is used. A qualified assessment of exposure can be made, for example, by prevention services.\line \line If a measurement shows that the limit value for asbestos is exceeded, the work must be stopped immediately and may not continue until the measures taken to reduce the concentrations to below the limit value.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 4. Cytostatics\line \line \line For work with cytostatic medicines and other toxic medicinal products having a lasting effect may it is good to provide training in order to secure that the work is only be carried out by a person with sufficient knowledge of the risks and the preventive measures.\line \line The employer may arrange for the required training. The specific training, should inter alia address the potential health risks in handling cytostatic medicines and other hazardous products, safety practices, protective equipment, measures in the event of splashing and spills, waste management, and care and maintenance of the equipment.\line \line \line It is good to organise training regularly in order to secure that the knowledge about safe routines is not forgotten. Training is needed especially for newly employed or when staff change work tasks and workplace for temporary employed, when introducing new equipment, new drugs and new routines.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 5. Curing plastics e.g. curing plastics, foam plastics, paint, adhesives\line \line 5.1. Introduction\line \line Chemical products may contain substances which are curing when mixed and applied e.g. on surfaces or in joints. Most of this kind of substances contain sensitising substances and good practice in using this kind of products is essential in order not to develop allergies, e.g. asthma and eczema.\line \line Read more about good practice when using\line \line 	Curing adhesives and paint - Epoxy and acid anhydrides\line 	Formaldehyde and its harts resins and acid cured lacquers\line 	Epoxy products, e.g. curing adhesives and paint\line 	UV-curing printing acrylate inks or lacquers\line \line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 6. Quartz\line \line \line 	\line Quartz is a natural part of many rocks and stones. Exposure to quartz dust occurs when exposed to road dust and stone dust and during treatment of material that contains rocks and stones, e.g. concrete. Exposure to quartz-containing dust may cause the serious lung disease silicosis and even cancer.\line \line \b Risk assessment\b0 \line \line Quartz risks needs to be assessed and measures taken to ensure that the risks are under control. Risk assessment needs to be carried out before the work starts. In the risk assessment it is good to include the following information:\line \line \line Activities: the operations likely to present a risk of exposure to quartz-containing dust,\line \line Sources of the emission and spreading of the quartz-containing\uc0{\u160} dusts;\line \line Process and process conditions\line \line Assessment of exposure (in relation to the national limit value),\line \line Assessment of the risk and of the need for action.\line \line What measures that should be in place and applied.\line \line \line \b Are measurements of workers\uc0{\u8217} exposure to quartz needed workersto assess the risks?\b0 \line \line In order to assess the risks, measurement of the exposure to quartz may be needed. The exposure should be compared with the limit value for quartz\line \line Examples of activities with low concentrations of quartz-dust in the air are (under normal conditions)\line \line Dental laboratories, where only small amounts (gram) of quartz-containing materials are used in each case.\line \line In industries where handling of quartz-containing material is made in an encapsulated\uc0{\u160} space with local exhaust ventilation.\line \line Where quartz-containing materials is used for water purification and the filter material is emptied from the packaging by water flushing in closed systems.\line \line For assistance with measurements, please contact an occupational health services or other skilled consultants.\line \line \line \b Measures to reduce the exposure to quartz\b0 \line \line Possible measures that can reduce the risks are:\line \line Those working with quartz or the supervisors of\uc0{\u160} such work need to be aware of the risks involved and how to work to avoid getting exposed to quartz dust.\line \line If any measures are necessary (e.g. special way of working or personal protective equipment), it is good to provide written instructions describing these measures.\line \line Work and workplaces shall be designed in such a way that people\uc0{\u8217}s exposure to quartz is as low as possible.\line \line Where possible, switch from quartz-containing materials with non-dangerous or less dangerous materials. For example, the quartz sand can be exchanged for olivine sand for moulding material in foundries, and silica powder as a filter aid or fillers in industry products can be exchanged for perlite. If this is not possible, the material can be washed, air stream separated or treated with a dust binding materials, so that it does not contain and emit less of the finest and most dangerous respirable quartz dust.\line \line Choose a work equipment that does not disperse dust, e.g.\line \line Use machines with local exhausts which capture quartz dust t as close as possible to where it is generated and emitted.\line \line Machines and dust generating e processes can be provided with enclosures, preferably with local exhaust ventilation attached. Tightness of the encapsulation and ensuring under-pressure is good to check regularly.\line \line It is good to only use hand-held machines which generate dust which have built-in dust extraction. . An alternative is to use waterspraying or water-flushing where possible.\line \line A good routine is to check the enclosures, ventilation and other measures are operating as intended regularly, e.g. every six months.\line \line Dust suppression techniques can be reduced by dust binding humidification or the addition of dust-binding substances.\line \line Work can be made from a cabin, in such a case the cabin needs to be equipped with ventilation with filters cleaning the supply air from dust (e.g. filter class F8).\line \line Define cleaning routines and then check that they are respected. Dust is best removed by vacuum cleaners or central vacuum cleaning. Cleaning by flushing water is an option if it is possible and safe. Don\uc0{\u8217}t sweep! Sweeping emits a lot of dust.\line \line If necessary, respiratory protection such as a half mask with P3-filter usually provides sufficient protection. If the work is heavy or ongoing for more than 2 hours it is good to use respiratory protective equipment should be powered and supplied-air. Working with respiratory protection makes it heavier to breathe. Supply air makes it easier to breathe and use respiratory protection for the entire time it is needed.\line \line Please note that quartz-containing materials is not recommended in the case of manual abrasive blasting; if quartz-containing materials are used in abrasive applications, it needs to be done in a closed containment or with water added to the sandblasting sand, so called hydroblast.\line \line \line It is good to review the measures at least once a year in order to check that they are operating as intended.\line \line \line \b Medical examination\b0 \line \line Quartz can cause silicosis and if someone starts developing silicosis it is important to identify that person as early as possible. The best way of controlling this is a medical examination. Therefore it can be a good idea that workers that may be exposed to quartz have regular medical check-ups, both before starting to work with quartz and then regularly, e.g. once every other year. The medical check before starting to work can show if the worker have a constitution which implies a high risk of developing lung diseases and developing diseases if exposed to quartz.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 7. Mineral wool\line \line There are several different kinds of mineral wool, e.g. glass wool, stone wool, slag wool, refractory mineral wool and glass fibres.\line \line Mineral wool may damage the lungs and often casuse irritation in contact with skin. In order to reduce exposure to dust containing mineral wool, it is important to:\line \line Choose products that release least dust and particularly the least fine fibres that are so small that they reach far into the lungs (respirable fibres).\line \line \line Have cleaning routines and comply with them. Dust is best removed by vacuum cleaners or central vacuum cleaning. Cleaning by flushing of water is an option if it is possible and safe. No sweeping and do not use compressed air! Sweeping emits a lot of dust. Compressed air is not a good cleaning device as it disperses dust into the air and only moves dust, not remove.\line \line \line Always use respiratory protection when if the work is dusty such as, for example, demolition and insulation of furnaces. Suitable respiratory protection is at least a half mask with P2-filter.\line \line \line Use protective clothing if the work is dusty. Protective clothing should be kept separate from other working clothes and personal clothing. Since the fibres in clothing can be trapped, they need to be washed.\line \line \line If clothes are heavily contaminated it is good to vacuum them before washing. It is good to label clothing contaminated by fibres when sent for washing in order for those handling the clothes to be able to take the necessary precautions to avoid exposure to the fibres.\line \line \line There is an unusual type of glass wool containing less than 18 % of alkaline earth metals (sodium, potassium, barium, calcium). This glass wool (not used for ordinary glass wool insulation) is to be considered as a \uc0{\u8220}speciality\uc0{\u8221} products, which may pose cancer risks.\line \line Clearly, the risks are greater when working with crystalline fibres and refractory fibres, speciality fibres compared to glass wool and stone wool. In order to know more about these more dangerous fibres, see the chapter on Refractory fibres.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 \line \line 8. Refractory fibres, speciality fibres and crystalline fibres\line \line \line Refractory fibres, speciality fibres and crystalline fibres (not standard mineral wool ) is likely to cause cancer.\line \line Therefore there are special needs to control and reduce exposure to these fibres.\line \line \line \b Measures to reduce risks\b0 \line \line \line Good practice to control and reduce exposure to these fibres are:\line \line Select refractory mineral wool (for example AES-fibres) instead of refractory fibres, crystalline fibres and special fibres in all cases where this is possible. Refractory\uc0{\u160} mineral wool is not as dangerous as the other fibres.\line \line Select products\uc0{\u160} which emits as little dust as possible.\line \line Have cleaning routines and follow them. Removed dust by a vacuum cleaner equipped with an effective filter, e.g. HEPA-filter or with central vacuum cleaning. Cleaning by flushing water is an option if it is possible and safe. No sweeping and do not use compressed air! Sweeping emits a lot of dust. Compressed air is not a good cleaning device as it disperses dust into the air and only moves dust, not remove. Use protective clothing if the work is dusty. Protective clothing must be kept separate from other working clothes and personal clothing.\line \line Since the fibres can be trapped in clothing, they need to be cleaned. It is good to label clothing contaminated by fibres when sent for washing in order for those handling the clothes to be able to take the necessary precautions to avoid exposure to the fibres.\line \line If respiratory protection is needed, it should be equipped with a P3-filter in order to provide adequate protection against the fibres.\line \line It is good practice to place production processes where these fibres are handled in such a way that dust is emitted in designated areas, as it is important to reduce the number of people exposed to this carcinogenic dust as much as possible. It is good to post signs with the words \uc0{\u8220}WARNING. Dust containing fibres\uc0{\u8220} at the entrance to such sites.\line \line It is also good practice to label machinery and other equipment containing refractory fibres, crystalline fibres and speciality fibres, so that it is clearly visible that they contain this kind of dangerous fibres.\line \line \line }

\par \pard \ql {\fs24 9. Contaminants in the work place air\line \line \line Contaminants in the work place air can be generated in many work process. Please find below some typical examples.\line \line \line All \b combustion processes\b0  will result in the production of a complex mixture of gases, vapours and solids depending on the fuel, the combustion conditions (e.g. temperature, level of oxygen) and control measures adopted to reduce emission of hazardous materials.\line \line One commonly encountered example is diesel exhaust fumes, arising from the combustion of diesel fuel in compression ignition engines. Emissions from diesel engines are complex mixtures of gases, liquids and solids. Many of the individual components have their own specific toxicity, and some have exposure limits assigned to them. Diesel engine exhaust is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) .\line \line Any process or activities that involve\b  heating, cutting or soldering or welding metal\b0  will produce a fume that again will contain a mixture of gases and particulate materials.\line \line \line The composition of welding fume depends on the type of welding process, the composition of the welding rod and the material being welded. The majority of the fume from metal welding is generated by the consumable (welding rod) rather than the substrate being welded. Information on the composition of the fume should be given on the safety data sheet provided with the consumable. Stainless steel, and other specialist alloys containing high levels of chromium, nickel and manganese carry a particularly high risk. Manual metal arc (stick) welding generates more fume than other techniques, such as MIG and TIG welding (metal inert gas, and tungsten inert gas). Although welding is most commonly used to join metals, other materials, such as plastics, are also welded and these processes can also generate toxic fumes which must be controlled.\line \line The physical and chemical composition of aerosols generated from metal cutting depends on the composition of the metal and any products applied to the surface of the metal. High exposures to welding and other metal fumes can cause metal fume fever, which can present itself as non-specific flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills etc.\line \line \line Other processes involving heating materials can lead to generation of process-generated contaminants. One example is Rubber fumes. There is a wide range of different base rubbers, both natural and synthetic, each with a unique chemical structure. In addition, during the production of rubber products, a wide range of varying chemical agents are used as fillers, vulcanising agents, accelerators and inhibitors, antidegradants and antioxidants, plasticisers, etc.\line \line Chemical agents present in rubber fumes may include various volatile agents (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, dimethylbenzenes, diisopropylbenzenes), polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and other agents As is generally the case for process-generated fumes, many of the individual components have their own specific toxicity, and some have exposure limits assigned to them.\line \line \line Many activities within the construction sector, as well as in the mining and quarrying sector, produce \b dusts \b0 which are released into the air. The exact composition of the dust will depend on factors such as: the types of activities; the materials/products that are being used; the materials used in the buildings that are being built, repaired or demolished; or the composition of the ore that is being mined or quarried. Dust generated in these activities often includes some amount of respirable crystalline silica (RCS). Similarly, asbestos exposure in Europe now mainly occurs during the repair, maintenance or demolition of buildings and hence could be considered a process-generated contaminant.\line \line Organic dusts may also be considered to be process-generated contaminants as they are emitted from organic materials that have undergone some degradation, resulting in a release of a complex mixture that can include a range of viable micro-organisms (e.g. fungal spores, bacteria, viruses) and their by-products including toxins, constituents of their cell-walls (e.g. endotoxins and glucans) and parts of living organisms. Exposure to organic dusts can occur in occupations and industry sectors that involve working with animals, plants and organic materials, including farming and collection and processing (e.g. composting) of household and other waste. Other organic contaminants may be released as aerosols, for example during the slaughtering and butchering of animals.\line \line An example of an organic dust is Wood dust, which is generated from sawing, sanding and other woodworking processes, and carries a variety of health risks. This includes the dust from hard and soft woods, and also composite materials such as medium density fibreboard (MDF) and chipboard, wood chippings used for animal litter or in the paper and pulp industry, or mulch made of wood chippings. Wood dust can cause asthma and is also classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a carcinogen[3].\line \line \line IARC has classified several process-generated substances as Group 1 \uc0{\u8211} Carcinogenic to humans (e.g. diesel engine exhaust, coal combustion, soot, and wood dust) and Group 2a \uc0{\u8211} probably carcinogenic to humans (e.g. welding fumes, bitumen, biomass fuel emissions, combustion of coal, gasoline engine exhaust). In addition, several occupations and industries are classified as Group 1 (e.g. rubber industry, painter) or Group 2b (e.g. firefighter, petroleum industry) where the causal agent has not been established, but where the process-generated emissions are likely to play an important role.\line \line \line }

Exchange of hazardous chemical products and substances\line \line \line \line Chemical risks may be reduced risks by substitution of a chemical product for a less dangerous product. Sometimes it is also possible to change processes in order to eliminate the need of the chemical product. Replacement of particularly hazardous chemical products is often the best course of action to mitigate the risks.\line \line \line Some particularly hazardous chemical products (containing carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substances) may be used only if it is shown that it is not technically possible to replace the product with other chemical products that present a lower risk.\line \b The substitution of hazardous chemical products and substances\b0 \line \line An easy way to investigate if it is possible to substitute a hazardous product is asking for tips from the sector, e.g. colleagues, suppliers or trade journals. Another option is to investigate the alternatives yourself. This will require more work, but may also result in very good solutions. It is important to try not only to switch to a similar chemical product, which may often bear similar risks but to review the whole approach.\line \line Below is more information on how you can proceed:\line \line Which are the most important chemical products to replace?\line \line A systematic approach for the substitution of hazardous chemical products and air contaminants.\line \line Examples of exchanges of dangerous chemical products\line \line Control whether the exchange has provided a good results\line \line \b Which are the most important chemical products to replace?\b0 \line \line Where it is technically possible, it is necessary to substitute chemical products which are labelled with\line \line \line 	R45: May cause cancer.\line 	H350: May cause cancer\line 	R49: May cause cancer by inhalation.\line 	R61: May cause harm to the unborn child.\line 	R46: May cause heritable genetic damage.\line 	H340: May cause genetic defects\line 	R60: May impair fertility.\line 	H360: May damage fertility or the unborn child.\line \line \line \line Certain substances shall not be used at all or have restrictions for their use. Normally, the suppliers are in control of which substances cannot be used. If you suspected that a chemical product contains any non-authorised substance, make a search in the ECHA Database..\line \line \line For selecting which chemical products are most important to substitute, you may apply the following rule of thumb: Substitute if possible:\line \line Products marked with the following hazard pictograms\line \line \line <img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/59-4.png" />\line \line \uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160}\uc0{\u160} \uc0{\u160}\line \line Danger Danger Danger\line \line Warning Warning Warning or or\line \line \line Products which are labelled with hazard statements indicating that the product may cause allergies.\line \line Products containing especially dangerous substances, such as those which contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer or are persistent and substances with endocrine disrupting effects. Many of these substances are marked:\line \line Warning\line \line \line <img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/59-1.png" style="height: 120px; width: 120px;" />\line \line \line \b Examples of the exchange of hazardous chemical products\b0 \line \line There are many good examples of how successful the replacement of dangerous chemical products towards less dangerous. Below are some examples that can serve as an inspiration.\line \line \line \b A systematic approach for substitution of hazardous chemical products\b0 \line \line When you want to replace a chemical product, it is good to be systematic. If you act without thorough evaluation, the result may be that you change to a chemical product with similar characteristics. If you instead take a more systematic approach you may find a other and profoundly different and better solutions.\line \line \line \b Proceed as follows:\b0 \line \line Examine why you want to replace the chemical product. What is the problem with the product? Why is it a problem and for whom? Why has the product/substance to be replaced? What is the function?? A close examination of this problem and the function of the chemical product that is often the basis for a successful exchange. It is a good idea to ask the question \uc0{\u8220}Why?\uc0{\u8221} for several times.\line \line Which often leads to the conclusion that the first reply does not constitute the best starting-point for changing the product. When examining carefully, you might find new openings, unexpected solutions.\line \line Discuss ways to cope with the needs which you identified in the first step 1. Be creative! At the start set no limits for practical or economic arguments.\line \line Assess the implications of the ideas which you identified in the next step Please consider\uc0{\u160} the aspects of health and safety at work, the external environment, economy, quality, technical characteristics, waste, time, efficiency, and other specific problems and difficulties.\line \line Compare the options and determine what is most important.\line \line Decide which system or alternatives should be tested.\line \line Carry out the test.\line \line Evaluate and select the chemical product or alternative technical solution, you wish to use.\line \line \line \b Control of exchanges planned or already made\b0 \line \line When a chemical product has been replaced, it should be verified that the exchange has given the desired effect.\line \line Check:\line \line Have you received good information on the risks to man and the environment from the new product?\line \line Such information is easiest to access for products which have been used for a longer time. Risks associated with new substances may be poorly known.\line \line It may be difficult for an individual company to assess the quality of the information on the risks posed by a (new) substance is. An expert may assist, e.g. from the occupational health service or similar.\line \line \line In connection with your change of a chemical product or substance, have you also altered other procedures or processes? Did you need to change the working procedures due to the introduction of the new chemical product?\line \line \line If you changed your production methods or your way of working you may need a broader evaluation of the new chemical products or substances.\line \line \line Proceed as follows:\line \line Talk to those who use or will use the new chemical product and find out what is different and if it is concerning both equipment and working methods.\line \line Examine what these changes mean for occupational health and safety. Review the entire process including e.g. aspects such as noise, vibrations, if manual work has changed and if work has become more heavy and so on.\line \line \line Is action needed to reduce any new problems that have arisen?\line \line \line Give priority to the most serious problems. It is often best and easiest to rectify what has to be done immediately. If that is not possible, there is a need for a plan for when and how measures are to be taken.\line \line \line }

Introduction\line \line \line \line Certain activities and processes imply particular chemical risks that need to be dealt with and controlled. Often, the risks in a sector, a process or for a profession are similar and predictable and can be controlled through applying good practice in a similar manner, regardless of workplace.\line \line On the pages about the different sectors, processes and professions we provide tips and advice on measures to reduce risk and which can be a way to cope with the relevant laws and rules. Applying good practice is a shortcut to controlling chemical risks and reduces the demands for elaborate risk assessments. Applying the good practice is often an easy, fast and effective way of complying with the general regulatory demands for safe handling of chemicals.\uc0{\u160} The good practice includes tips and advice on measures that reduce and control risks.\line \line \line Good practice is described for some common sectors, processes and professions where chemical risks need to be controlled.\line \line \line The good practice mainly corresponds to the EU Directive 98/24/EC on risks related to chemical agents at work, demanding risk identification, assessment and control. This Directive is implemented and sometimes complemented in the national legislation of the member states.\line \line Below is an\uc0{\u160} overview of sectors, processes and professions for which we provide good practice.\line \line There are, of course, many more sectors, processes and professions which may pose risks. For all sectors, processes and professions, the general regulations about risk assessment and measures to control the chemical risks apply. Read more about that under These routines must work. The action to be taken depends on how the risk is assessed.\line \line \line This guide informs on different types of practical measures to reduce chemical risks. There is a comprehensive body of European and national legislation for these and more substances that present specific demands for these as well as other sectors, processes and professions.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 16. Hairdressers\line \line Many products used in hairdressing, such as hair dyes, products for permanent waving and fixatives are irritating to the skin and respiratory tract. These products may also contain products which can cause eczema and allergies.\line \line For products labelled with a hazard pictogram the suppliers needs to provide a safety data sheet, which should be kept as it provides information on the risks as well as the protective measures needed. The protective measures described should be applied. There is no requirement to provide safety data sheets for cosmetic products, still it is useful if the supplier can provide it.\line \line \line Good practice when working with chemical products in hairdressing is:\line \line \line Check that the general ventilation works well in the hairdressing saloon. A very effective way of reducing exposure to air contaminants during perm and dyeing is to use a transparent exhaust hood, placed above the customer\uc0{\u8217}s head.\line \line \line A fume cupboard (ventilated cabinets) can be used when mixing hair dyes. Alternatively, this can be done under an exhaust hood as the one described above.\line \line In order to avoid exposure to dust from bleaching products, the product can be bought in special packaging which do not need to be opened until the mixture is ready. An alternative is to leave the hydrogen peroxide to be absorbed in in the bleaching powder.\line \line Try to replace dangerous products (for information on risks look at the label with pictograms and the safety data sheet) with less dangerous products;\line \line Use metal tools, e.g. metal clips - which do not release nickel (nickel may cause allergies). It is suitable using scissors with plastic coated handles.\line \line Check that there is access to emergency eye-wash, in case of getting dust or splashes of chemical products in the eyes. The easiest way is emergency eye-wash connected to the tap in a wash basin. The eyewash may be complemented by an emergency eye-wash bottle.\line \line Gloves should be worn at all times when dealing with chemical products. It is best to use disposable gloves made of plastic. The gloves must be clean and dry inside. A protective apron can be used when appropriate.\line \line Take care of your skin and hands. Use hand lotion extensively. Avoid wearing rings, watches and wrist-wear since chemical products may remain under them.\line \line Evaluate the risks in hairdressing and take the precautions needed to control the risks. If such measures are not applied, the risks will increase.\line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 17. Electro plating, nickel-plating, chromating\line \line Electro-plating as well as nickel-plating and chromating involves the use of toxic and corrosive chemicals in baths. Sometimes solvents are also used for degreasing. It is important to avoid inhalation of vapours and mists from the bath as well as from degreasing of the metal products to be plated. Splashes and skin contact with the liquids should also be avoided. In addition, there is a risk that gases (such as hydrogen) and vapours from organic solvents can form explosive mixtures with air.\line \line National regulations\line \line Good practice that reduces the risks are:\line \line \b Risk assessment\b0 \line \line Before assessing the risks, we recommend that you check the measures described below. They describe good practice and applying good practice is often a good way of controlling r reducing the most common and severe risks.\line \line Make risk assessments for every step, such as e.g. cleaning, degreasing, pickling, chromium plating, hard chromium plating, nickel plating and electro-plating.\line \line \line \b Knowledge of risks\b0 \line \line Ensure that all staff have a good understanding of the risks\uc0{\u160} chemical risks. and know how to avoid and control the risks. Also temporary workers, including cleaners need to be aware of the risks and how to work safely and protect themselves.\line \line If it is important to follow safety instructions in order to avoid severe injuries, it is good to provide written instructions on how to work and what protective equipment to use. Examples of severe risks and injuries are burns and inhalation of mist from the baths, which can cause cancer in the long term. It is good practice providing written safety instructions for processes with a low degree of automation and open baths and open handling, dosage and mixing of chemicals.\line \line \line \b Measures that apply to all types of electro-plating, nickel-plating and chromating\line \line The premises\b0 \line \line The premises with the baths should be separated from other activities. The general ventilation needs to be effective in order to evacuate air contaminants quickly and efficiently and prevent them from spreading to adjacent premises. Regular maintenance of the ventilation is needed to ensure that it continues to function well.\line \line Emergency lighting may be necessary, for example if baths are embedded in the floor.\line \line It is good practice to provide hand washing facilities close to where the work is done.\line \line \line \b Baths\b0 \line \line Encapsulation of the baths and automation of the process as well as the dosage of chemicals reduce the emission of air contaminants from the baths. Avoid manual handling of chemicals and goods if possible.\line \line Effective process ventilation at each bath is a good way of reducing emission of mist from the baths.\line \line Investigate if it is possible to reduce generation of mist by adding wetting agent to the baths.\line \line Make sure it is not possible to fall into the baths when working close to them. The baths may, for example, be equipped with protective devices such as covers or guard rails.\line \line It is advantageous if hoists and other lifting equipment for goods (including any dosage of chemicals) are operated at a distance from the baths, in order to reduce the risk of exposure to splashes and mist.\line \line It is recommended to shield or cover baths that are not used.\line \line \line \b Safety routines\b0 \line \line Ensure that there are good and functioning routines for supervision and control of production equipment, lifting equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE), labelling and signposting. If the equipment does not function as intended, there is a risk that attempts to rectify the problem by, for example, interfere with the baths, which increases the risk of accidents.\line \line \line Ensure that there are good and functioning routines for cleaning, including\line \line \line 	Cleaning of ventilation\line 	The edges of the baths\line 	That spillage and leakages is taken care of.\line \line \line \line If the work involves particular risks if workers are not aware of the risks or do not follow the work and safety instructions a written work permit may be appropriate in order to be in control of who is working with the most risky operations. Written work permits can be individual or be valid for a limited time. Work permits can be supplemented with work and safety instructions. Work permits may be appropriate, for instance for,\line \line work on equipment for electrolytic surface treatment, such as cleaning, repair, maintenance or change of anodes\line \line work in pipes or tanks for corrosive chemicals, such as change of gaskets or valves or change in tubing\line \line \uc0{\u8220}hot work\uc0{\u8221}, for example, welding, especially when working on or inside vessels which have contained flammable goods.\line \line All electrical equipment should be explosion protected.\line \line \line \b Labelling and signs\b0 \line \line Are pipes and technical equipment for chemicals labelled with information about the content (name of the chemical and the risk it poses) and the direction of the flow? This applies, for example, to devices for draining, mixing or dosage of chemicals as well as equipment for degreasing, pickling and coating.\line \line See Signs and labelling.\line \line \line \b Storage of chemicals\b0 \line \line Store chemicals in well ventilated storages. Chemicals, which may react with each other should be stored separately.\line \line It is good to limit the storage of chemicals in the production premises to at the maximum the daily ration of chemicals.\line \line Tanks for chemicals should be placed on a drainage screen in a retaining dike.\line \line Ensure that truck driving and handling of cargo does not harm the packages with chemicals (risk of leakage).\line \line Avoid packages that can be easily damaged when handled, such as glass demijohns and paper sacks.\line \line For more information, see Storage of chemical products and substances.\line \line \line \b Use of chemicals\b0 \line \line Ensure that chemicals are not confused or mixed involuntarily and by accident. A good solution is to have different types of joints for the pipes for different chemicals. Label packages and equipment that is intended to be used only for certain chemicals.\line \line If possible, use chemicals in liquid form instead of powder. Liquid chemicals may be dosed with a pump which emits less air contaminants than when pouring powder. It is good to check and maintain the pumps regularly.\line \line If powdered chemicals are used, the emission of air contaminants can be reduced through dissolving them in a vessel with stirrer, pump and local exhaust ventilation.\line \line \line \b Personal protective equipment\b0 \line \line The staff needs to have access to respiratory protection, eye protection, safety boots, gloves and protective clothing. Soiled clothes and footwear needs to be taken off immediately. Working-clothes should be kept separate from personal clothes. See Personal protective equipment.\line \line \line \b Emergency eye wash fountain and emergency shower\b0 \line \line If there is a risk of splashes or being flooded by chemicals, fast and easy access to emergency eye wash fountain and emergency shower is needed. Fast and easy access to emergency showers is important to alleviate burns. Emergency showers may be connected to an alarm, in order to draw attention if someone may need help. See Emergency eye wash fountain and emergency shower.\line \line \line \b Handling recently treated goods\b0 \line \line Take down goods from the hangers in another room than where the electrolytic surface treatment takes place. Separate the rooms with for example, a plastic or leather drapery in the doorway through which the lifting and transport device can move the goods from the bath.\line \line It is good practice always to use the protective gloves when working with newly treated goods.\line \line \line \b Emptying and cleaning of baths\b0 \line \line Empty baths using pumps to avoid any contact with the electrolyte.\line \line To clean baths, use of low pressure devices is recommended (high pressure devices emits mist which may carry and spread dangerous substances)\line \line \line \b Exchange of hexavalent chromium chromating\b0 \line \line Chromating with trivalent chromium (Cr (III) is less harmful to health than hexavalent chromium. Trivalent chromium works well for decorative plating but is not as good for hard chromium plating.\line \line Two EU directives, (ELV-16) prohibit the use of hexavalent chromium in vehicles.\line \line Chromating works above a certain size are covered by the IED Directive and needs to consider converting to less hazardous chemicals.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 18. Laboratory work\line \line \line \line Chemical laboratory work entails working with chemical substances. The risks vary widely, depending on the type of laboratory work.\line \line National regulations\line \line In general the following good practices reduce the risks:\line \line \line Always use a fume cupboard or similar when working with hazardous substances. Check the air velocity at least once a year. It is recommended that the velocity should not be less than in average 0.5 m/s across the opening of the fume cupboard, regardless of if the hatch/door is in a high up or low position. It may be appropriate to provide fume cupboards with a fixed measuring device which measures and shows the airflow, and where the normal operating mode is indicated.\line \line If working with substances which pose a risk to life or serious injury (acute and chronic) the fume cupboard can be fitted with an alarm which alerts if the airflow falls below a set value. It is good to check the alarm and alarm limits regularly. Results and dates of all checks carried out can be kept near the fume cupboard.\line \line \line Consider the following recommendations and measures:\line \line Keep a negative pressure in the laboratory compared to adjacent premises, in order to avoid fumes to spread to adjacent premises.\line \line Prepare written information, e.g. a placard with risk and safety information if there is a risk of accidents or illness when working with reaction vessels, other apparatus and similar.\line \line Pipetting should not be carried out using the mouth.\line \line Limit the quantity of hazardous substances in the laboratory to what is needed for the job.\line \line Avoid using fume cupboards you are working in as a storage area for equipment or chemicals.\line \line Mark all bottles, cans, and barrels etc. which are used for storage of chemicals, with the name of the chemical, the hazard pictogram (pictogram) and warnings.\line \line Ensure that all containers of hazardous substances are properly closed.\line \line Immediately remove spills with an appropriate absorbent.\line \line Avoid keeping, cooking or consuming food or drink in the laboratory.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 19. Welding and thermal cutting\line \line Welding and thermal cutting generate air contaminants which contain dangerous substances. These substances may cause discomfort and illnesses in the respiratory tract. Welding and thermal cutting may also cause fire and explosion, if the safety precautions are not respected.\line \line Good practice in welding and thermal cutting\line \line \line All work with welding and thermal cutting\line \line \line Check that the welding and thermal cutting equipment and especially hoses, gaskets and valves are in order and supplied with safety against back-fire. Welding burner should be equipped with a non return valve between the welding pistol and the hose. Check that protective glove and cut-off keys are available.\line \line \line It is good to provide written instruction that make clear what safety routines should be applied, e.g.\line \line - Before welding and thermal cutting, clean the workplace and remove combustible material such as dust and waste material. If there are holes or cuts in the floor or walls, they can be watered or covered before starting to weld\line \line Screen off the workplace e.g. with curtains or movable screens, if needed\line \line Ensure easy access to fire fighting equipment including blankets and heat-insulated glove.\line \line Return welding and thermal cutting equipment including gas bottles to its storage place after finalising the work.\line \line Special safety instructions may be needed if welding or cutinng in painted materials. If the pain contains polyurethane (PU), isocyanates may be formed during welding and cutting. Isocyanates may cause harm to the respiratory tract as well as allergies. Measures are needed to remove the paint sufficiently in order to prevent it from being heated over about 150 oC, which is the temperature at which isocyanates may be formed.\line \line Use effective local exhausts that remove welding fumes from the breathing zone. For MIG- welding, this can be effectively done using a welding pistol with an integrated local exhaust.\line \line Follow the safety instructions for the handling of gas bottles.\line \line Use the appropriate personal protective equipment including respiratory protection, helmet and visor, protective clothes suited for welding and thermal cutting and protective shoes.\line \line \line \b Welding and cutting in vessels that have contained flammable liquids.\b0 \line \line \line Welding in vessels which have contained flammable liquids is hazardous and many severe accidents have occurred when small remains of liquid have started to burn or exploded when starting to weld on the vessel.\line \line \line It is good practice to ensure that only those well aware of the risks and how to work safely are allowed to do this kind of welding and thermal cutting. One way of ensuring this is to require a written working permit for this kind of work. The work permit can be issued for a person and for a limited time.\line \line Make sure that the vessel is cleaned before starting to work on it. Cleaning can be made e.g. by blowing steam into it for 15 minutes or cleaning the vessel with water and keeping it filled with water during the welding operation.\line \line Ensure that the vessel is well ventilated before the work starts and until it has been finalised\line \line \line \b Welding and cutting in confined and poorly ventilated spaces\b0 \line \line \line Respiratory protection is necessary to avoid breathing high concentrations of welding fume. In order to make it easy to breathe through the respirator, a respirator with fan-assisted supply air or a compressed air supplied respirator is recommended.\line \line Arrange for supplying fresh air into the confined space, if possible.\line \line Warning! Do not use oxygen to improve the air quality. Oxygen can be accumulated in clothes and makes them more easily catching fire.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 20. Spray painting\line \line Spray painting can be made using both powder (powder spraying and electrostatic spraying), water-based and solvent-based paint. During spray-painting the concentrations of dust may get high. In additions, skin contact with certain paints and solvents may cause eczemas and work with certain curing paints implies risk for allergy. For some solvent based paints there is a risk of fire and even explosions. This is why measures to reduce exposure is needed in spray painting.\line \line \line The following good practice can be applied to reduce the risks.\line \line \line \b All kinds of paint\b0 \line \line \line For the spray-painting constituting the highest risks such as high-pressure spray-painting, electrostatic spray-painting and powder spraying it is good to have written safety instructions describing e.g.\line \line How paint and solvents should be handled\line \line Measures to reduce the risk of fire and explosions\line \line Use and maintenance of personal protective equipment\line \line Cleaning routines\line \line \line It is also good to have formalized and written routines for:\line \line \line 	Cleaning of the spray booth\line 	Change of the dry filter in the exhaust from the spray booth\line 	Checking and adjusting of the water level and concentration of chemicals in the wet filter box\line 	Cleaning of ventilation ducts and fans\line 	Control of the air flow in the local exhausts as well as air velocity in the ducts and fall of pressure\line 	Control of ground connection (to prevent static electricity)\line \line \line \line \b Spray-paint only in especially designed spaces\b0 , e.g. spray booths, spraying room or tunnel: The space/rooms needs to be very well ventilated and the ventilation should continue a while after finalizing the spray-painting. The ventilations systems need to be cleaned, controlled and maintained regularly.\line \line \line \b Cover surfaces in spray booths \b0 and similar with paper or plastics to facilitate cleaning. The walls can for example be covered with a plastic film which is mounted on the clean surface. After spraying, the stained plastic film can be easily removed.\line \line For odd jobs when spray booths cannot be used due to the size or shape of the object to be painted, it is important to plan the job to secure a good working environment for the operator. Ensure that the ventilation in the premises is good and if needed, improve the ventilation with mobile fans. Respiratory protection is needed. Check that fire extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment are easily available near the workplace. If possible, the spray-painting can be made as the last task during the working day, to reduce the people exposed to the spray mist as well as the time of exposure. After finalizing the spray-painting, ventilate the premises.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 21. Confined spaces\line \line \line \b Examples of hazardous situations\b0 \line \line Oxygen deficiency and risks of fire and explosion have led to several serious occupational accidents and also several deaths. Serious risks are for example:\line \line Enclosed spaces, for example, silos, tanks, cargo space on boats, containers used for the storage or transport of fish or peat\line \line Other organic matter which can degrade or rot (when oxygen is consumed in the degradation process, oxygen concentration in the enclosed space is reduced and that there could be a lack of oxygen)\line \line Tanks and vessels used for inflammable or explosive liquids, gases or powders posing, e.g. organic solvents or fuels.\line \line Pits and trenches may be so deep and narrow that the air is not mixed with ambient air, the air becomes \uc0{\u8220}stationary\uc0{\u8221}. If there are dangerous gases, e.g. marsh gas or methane from the decomposition of waste, the air can be explosive as well as deficient in oxygen.\line \line If gas welding is made in small and poorly ventilated areas high concentrations of carbon monoxide may be formed, leading to nausea, headache, fainting and, in the worst case, death.\line \line Venting of newly mounted district heating pipes which have been welded together, the venting is often made via a valve which end in a closed space. If gas welding has been used, the pipes contain carbon monoxide, which will be emitted to the closed space during venting. Deaths have occurred when the operator surveying the venting has fainted due to lack of oxygen and then has been splashed by hot water from the district heating pipe.\line \line \line \b Check the air before starting to work\b0 \line \line Before starting to work in closed spaces such as tanks, wells, silos, cargo spaces or similar, the risks at work needs to be assessed. Such an assessment and check needs to always be carried out before starting work in a closed space where there is a risk of dangerous gases. The work can start after it has been controlled that there is no oxygen deficit in the closed space, that there is no harmful concentration of gas, and that there is no risk of explosion.\line \line The risk assessment can include:\line \line Measuring the oxygen concentration to check that it is not too low. If the oxygen level is too low one quickly becomes unconscious and several deaths have occurred in this way. If there is a risk of oxygen deficit, the oxygen concentration needs to be measured before starting to work.\line \line If the closed space can contain residues or vapours of fire and/or explosive substances, measurement is needed in order to verify there is no risk of explosion (unless it is evident that the levels are very low and there is absolutely no risk of explosion).\line \line Measure the concentration of harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulphide which may be present.\line \line An alternative to measurements is to ventilate the space during several hours before starting to work in it. However, if choosing this alternative it is necessary to ensure that the ventilation is efficient (only to remove a cover or make an opening in the tank will typically not be sufficient).\line \line \line \b On the measurement of the risk of explosion\b0 \line \line Risk of explosion is measured using an explosion detector. Verify that the explosion detector is intended for use in areas with risks of explosions.\line \line At the same time as measuring the risk of explosion, it is good to also measure the oxygen concentration. Often the risk of explosion is underestimated if the oxygen concentration is lower than normal.\line \line For work which is not hot and does not contain any source of ignition, good practice is that not exceed 25 % of the lower explosive limit (if the oxygen concentration is 21 %).\line \line For hot work good practie is not to exceed 5 % of the lower explosive limit 5 % (at an oxygen concentration of 21 %).\line \line \line \b Use respiratory protection if the air is not safe\b0 \line \line If it is not possible to ventilate a closed space to remove hazardous air contaminants and supply clean air and oxygen, respiratory protection, should be used. The respiratory protection should protect against the air contaminants that may occur. For example, respiratory protection with compressed-air supply is the only equipment which protects if there is oxygen deficiency in the closed space.\line \line \line \b Never work alone\b0 \line \line When working in tanks, wells, silos, cargo spaces or similar, it is important to be in contact with someone nearby who is able to observe the work in the closed space.\line \line A number of severe accidents have occurred when people have fainted due to lack of oxygen in a closed space. When this has been discovered it has happened that a colleague has entered the room to investigate what happened, and then also that second person has fainted. Deaths have occurred. It is therefore important to make it possible to remove a person from such an area without any need to go into the confined space. Use of a safety harness with a rope with the other end outside the confined space when entering into a confined space is good as a start, but needs to be complemented with some kind of lifting device.\line \line \line \b Work permit\b0 \line \line When working inside a tank, well, silo or cargo space where there are flammable liquids,\line \line written work permit is a good way of controlling that only those with the right competence conduct this kind of dangerous work tasks.\line \line The written work permit can be complemented with description of work instructions and safety instructions which are necessary to follow in order to carry out the work in a safe manner\line \line \line }

Asbestos\line \line 3.1.Introduction\line \line \line \line The following applies to all work with asbestos\line \line \line Working with asbestos requires effective measures that reduce the exposure to asbestos, but also notification, training, medical checks and measurements.\line \line If asbestos must be removed, it is simplest to make use of the services of a contractor for the remediation of asbestos. In order to ensure that the contractor complies with the applicable laws and rules for the removal of asbestos, it is good to be clear about the requirements on the contractor. These requirements can be included in the procurement demands and in agreement with the contractor.\line \line \line 3.2. Measures prior to the commencement of work:\line \line \line \line 	Check that you have made the notification needed, that the workers have the training and medical checks required and that the measurements needed for risk assessments are carried out.\line 	Examine which materials containing or likely to contain asbestos.\line 	For demolition \uc0{\u8212} if there is the slightest doubt as to whether asbestos is present, request information on the presence of asbestos in the building to be demolished, the owner or the owner of the technical device (such as machinery).\line 	Specific arrangements and equipment is needed to work with asbestos safely. Work therefore needs to be planned carefully, so that all necessary arrangements are in place when work starts.\line 	It is important to be prepared to protect staff if something unexpected occurs. Assess risks and describe how the work is to be carried out and the protective equipment to be used in safety instructions; the instructions shall be available at the workplace. In demolition processes the instructions needs to be adapted to the situation at the establishment concerned. The written working and safety instructions shall contain the following information on the measures:\line 	how to prevent dust suppression\line 	the need for personal protective equipment\line 	cleaning up after demolition\line 	handling the waste\line 	personal hygiene.\line \line \line \line 3.3. Organising the work\line \line \line \line Organise the work so that as few workers as possible are in contact with and exposed to asbestos.\line \line Plan the work so that there is time to keep the facilities and equipment clean. Clean up dust containing asbestos fibres continuously. If equipment is to be transported to another location for cleaning \uc0{\u8212} put it in sealed packaging before transport.\line \line Smoking is forbidden within the defined area in which asbestos is present.\line \line \line \b Labelling and signage\b0 \line \line Place of work where asbestos is present and concentrations will probably exceed the threshold limit value must be clearly delimited and clearly marked with warning signs, e.g. \uc0{\u8220}Asbestos work \uc0{\u8212} No access of non-authorised persons\uc0{\u8221} or for demolition; \uc0{\u8220}Caution \uc0{\u8212} Demolition \uc0{\u8212} Asbestos \uc0{\u8212} Access prohibited for unauthorised persons\uc0{\u8217}.\line \line Packaging and containers containing asbestos or materials containing asbestos, shall be clearly marked with warnings which must contain the word \uc0{\u8220}asbestos\uc0{\u8221}.\line \line \line 3.4. Respiratory protection\line \line \line \line Breathing protection shall be chosen so that it fits the user (fit is important in order to have a high level of protection).\line \line The only type of respiratory protective equipment providing protection against asbestos are powered and supplied-air respirators. In exceptional cases filter masks may be used but only if the air does not contain high concentrations of asbestos and the work is not be physically demanding.\b  In practice, the situation is almost always that powered and supplied-air respirator is the only option which secures good enough protection against asbestos.\b0 \line \line \line 3.5. Workwear\line \line \line \line Comprehensive and close-fitting protective clothing incorporating a hood shall be used for all activities, with direct contact with asbestos, for instance in the event of demolition and when working with installations which contain asbestos. The protective clothing needs to be dust repelling and designed in such a way that no dust is collected in the fold, pockets or similar.\line \line Work clothing and personal clothing should not be kept together.\line \line Work clothing contaminated by asbestos should not be allowed to be laundered, together with other garments. (Studies show that asbestos workers families also have an increased incidence of diseases related to exposure to asbestos, which is considered to be due to exposure to asbestos in family members working clothes.)\line \line Containers containing the clothes used when working with asbestos must be clearly marked with the words \uc0{\u8216}asbestos contaminated protective clothing\uc0{\u8217}.\line \line \line 3.6. Waste\line \line \line \line Waste, materials, empty packaging, filters and other material containing asbestos, shall immediately be placed in closed containers and stored so until it can be finally disposed of.\line \line \line 3.7. On completion of the work\line \line \line \line Clean up carefully, so that no dust containing asbestos fibres still present on any surfaces.\line \line \line }

Safety instructions is a way of making it clear how to work and what kind of equipment including protective equipment to use in order to avoid getting injured.\line \line \line Safety instructions describe in detail e.g.\line \line how the work is to be carried out in order to be safe, e.g. what preparations are needed to work safely, e.g. switching on exhaust ventilation, what equipment to use or what to do when work ends\line \line what protective equipment to use.\line \line when and where the protective equipment should be used,\line \line how it should be maintained\line \line \line what to do in the event of an accident to occur (for example if it becomes a temporary spillage or first aid is needed).\line \line \line If the instructions are simple, oral information is sufficient. If the instructions are extensive or many workers or others need to have the same information, it is good to write instructions which are available at the workplace. It is also important to instruct temporary workers.\line \line \line A good basis for the safety instructions are the SDS which includes protective measures to be followed when working with the product. Safety Data Sheets, section 8, provide general information on protection. The Sections 7, 10, and 13 also contain information on how to work with products or substances.\line \line \line If the work varies so much that it is not possible to make detailed general safety instructions and describe how to work, it is important that the person carrying out the work has a good knowledge of the risks and the safety measures required and is able to make own risk assessment.\line \line \line If one or more members of staff should develop their own safety instructions, time should be allocated to the risk assessment and planning of how to work safely. Furthermore, the staff members concerned must be able to decide about measures and be able to discuss more extensive and costly measures with his/her manager.\line \line \line The employer remains responsible at all times for ensuring safety regardless of who is doing the risk assessment and developing safety measures.\line \line Further information:\line \line Verification of whether all known to the working and safety instructions\line \line Example: Written terms and any safety instructions for spray painting\line \line \line \b Written safety instructions\b0 \line \line If it is important to follow the safety instructions in order not to get injured by chemicals and if it is important that several people are aware of the safety instructions, written safety instructions are recommended \uc0{\u160}\line \line \line It is good to keep written safety instructions easily visible and accessible to those concerned by the instructions e.g. placed on the machine or a wall and written in the language understood by them workers\line \line Written safety instructions should also be given orally.\line \line \line For certain activities which require a work permit is needed to have written work and safety instructions.\line \line \line }

Register of chemical products and generated substances\line \line \line \line As a basis for chemical risk management, it is good to have a register of chemical products and generated substances. This register serves as a basis for deciding what chemical risks may be present in the business and what risks needs to be assessed.\uc0{\u160} \uc0{\u160}\line \line All chemical products which are marked with a hazard pictogram must can be included in this register . In addition, substances generated in the working processes, for example, dust from grinding and drilling or smoke from e.g. welding and exhausts and can be included in the register.\line \line \line The register serves as input to the risk assessment and may be carried out as part of the risk assessment.\line \line \line It may be useful to have one or more lists of all the chemical products used within the company or within certain parts of the company. One way of starting to make such a list is to collect all safety data sheets in a binder. Just remember to organise the binder in a way which makes it easy to find a safety data sheet when and if needed-A binder usually works well if there are not too many different chemical products so that all safety data sheets can be stored in one or two binders. Enterprises which handle many chemical products and substances can instead list the chemicals in a document. An electronic list often including also access to safety data sheets is possible in companies where all the users of the products and substances have access to a computer.\line \line \line \b Register in the form of a binder\b0 \line \line A register in the form of a binder is often easy, especially for companies with a limited number of chemical products. The safety data sheets are ordered in this binder in a systematic manner. What suits you best?\line \line A single binder for the entire company or one for e.g. each department or different types of operations.. A rule of thumb can be that all SDSs must fit in one binder.\line \line Do you need to have two versions of the register? One for the office and one for the workplace? In that case, don\uc0{\u180}t forget that updates need to be made in both.\line \line \line In the binder it shall be easy to find the safety data sheets. To deploy the Safety Data Sheets in alphabetical order of their names is usually a good way to organise the binder\line \line \line If other substances are generated during work, for example, smoke, dust or mist the register may include a list of those substances and risks.\line \line \line Keep the register up to date and remove safety data sheets for products and substances which are no longer used in the company. It can be made continuously or, for example, once a year. If you buy new products or substances, it is good to insert the safety data sheet directly in the binder..\line \line \line \b Register in the form of an electronic list\b0 \line \line An electronic lists it particularly good for businesses with large numbers of chemical products or substances. A well-designed list provides quick and easy information about the chemical products or substances used within the company, provided that all staff who may need the information have access to a computer. In that case staff may at any time obtain information on a product.\line \line An electronic list can be made for the entire company or parts of it. The register can include information about the products such as\line \line the use\line \line product name\line \line supplier\line \line place of storage/use\line \line labelling and hazard statements\line \line special regulations that apply e.g. exposure limit values\line \line annual quantities consumed (approximately)\line \line link to the suppliers\uc0{\u8217} websites\line \line electronic safety data sheets or links to such sheets (paper versions of SDS may be scanned in)\line \line if the products contain any substances which may become prohibited\line \line safety instructions.\line \line Information on products which contain substances on restricted substances lists. See e.g.<a href="https://echa.europa.eu/es/"> ECHAs web-site</a>.\line \line \line If substances such as dust, mist or smoke are generated in the processes or from the activities in the company, this may also be listed in the electronic register.\line \line \line }

Risk assessment\line \line \line \line \b What is a risk assessment?\b0 \line \line \line A risk assessment is an assessment of the risk of damage, for example, when dealing with a chemical product or when exposed to air contaminants generated (so-called \uc0{\u8216}chemical hazard).\line \line \line The risk assessment is used to determine whether the work is carried out in a manner which is safe enough, or if there is a need for action to reduce the risk.\line \line \line When carrying out the risk assessment, it must be borne in mind that risk can depend on a number of different factors:\line \line \line How you work with the product or substance and how much you come into contact with it.\line \line The way in which you come into contact with the product or substance \uc0{\u8212} skin, inhalation or ingestion.\line \line The intrinsic properties of the substances in the chemical product.\line \line The duration and frequency of the exposure.\line \line If high exposures may occur, e.g. during certain work tasks.\line \line The risk of accidents for example temporary spillage or accidental release.\line \line \line \b Simplify the risk assessment by starting with applying good practice!\b0 \line \line The risk assessment will be easier if the risks are small. There is often a \uc0{\u8220}good practice\uc0{\u8221} for tasks and activities, including the safety measures that need to be applied. If the good practice include how to control and reduce the chemical risks, it is good to start your risk assessment with checking that you apply the good practice.\line \line \line The application of good practice often provides good control of the risks. In KemiGuiden, we have entered the descriptions of what is good practice for various activities and substances. The OiRA tools also include descriptions of good practice for different sectors and operations.\line \line \line Before starting with the risk assessments, check that you apply good practice. Good practice is often based on risk assessments made by experts. The safety measures often apply to most similar businesses, but adaptation of the good practice to the conditions in each company may also be needed.\line \line \line \b Who will do the risk assessment?\b0 \line \line The employer is responsible for the risk assessment. Often it is good to start together with the workers making a risk assessment of their work with chemical products. On the one hand this increase their knowledge of the chemical products they are working with and, on the other hand, the risk assessment will make use of the workers knowledge on how the chemical products are handled .\line \line \line Sometimes the risk assessment might be more difficult, and help from someone more skilled may be needed. In order, for example, to assess the risk associated with substances generated from processes, or the risk of inhalation of air contaminants from chemical products, it may be necessary to seek the help of the occupational health services or any other skilled consultant. It may for example be necessary to perform measurements to check if concentrations of air contaminants exceed the threshold limit value.\line \line \line \b What risks have to be assessed?\b0 \line \line \line \b What should be assessed?\b0 \line \line \line Risk assessment shall be carried out for all dangerous substances, that is to say chemical products and substances used at the workplace and are labelled with the hazard pictogram (or pictogram orange).\line \line There are other chemical products or substances that have to part of the risk assessment, too, for example, hazardous waste and air contaminants generates. Air contaminants may e.g. be generated during: :\line \line \line Processing or treating materials in various ways, e.g. sanding.\line \line Hot work, such as, for example, welding, soldering and vulcanization of rubber.\line \line Demolition work\line \line Chemical reactions\line \line \line Substances formed may e.g. be welding fumes, soldering fumes, combustion gases, different types of dusts and mists or fumes/vapour from, for example, heating of thermoplastics.\line \line In the office environments substances may evaporate and be emitted e.g. when starting to use new computers.\line \line \line Risks can also be caused by products which are not labelled with pictograms, for example, water and food. Permanent work with water can cause skin problems, food can cause allergic reactions. If this kind of problems are present in your company, include that it in your risk assessment.\line \line \line \b List the chemical products and air contaminants to be assessed\b0 \line \line It is good to start by listing the chemical products and air contaminants present in the establishmenti. How this is done, you can choose and adapt so as to fit in with the activities.\line \line Link to Block 45 (new number)\line \line \line \b The risks to be assessed?\b0 \line \line When carrying out a risk assessment, it is assessed whether and where action is needed to avoid injuries due to the chemical product or substance generated. For certain substances there may be specific risks which should not be overlooked. This concerns:\line \line risk of fire and explosion when working with inflammable and explosive products\line \line the risk of burns when working with hot chemical products or hot water.\line \line \line \b The risk assessment needs to take into account workers who are especially sensitive or vulnerable:\b0 \line \line Young workers. They do not have the same experience as older and experienced workers. In addition, young workers are more vulnerable to chemical substances than adults.\line \line Pregnant and breastfeeding women. Foetuses are very sensitive to chemical substances.\line \line Workers working alone.\line \line \line }
