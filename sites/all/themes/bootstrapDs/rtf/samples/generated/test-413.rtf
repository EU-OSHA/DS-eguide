\par \pard \ql {\fs24 1.2. Carcinogenic and mutagenic substances\line \line \line \line Substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic give rise to serious risks, which usually are not immediately noticeable when in contact with the substance, but which may result in serious effects in the form of cancer after several years, or which may harm the next generation, by their impact on reproductive performance, foetus or genetic damage. \b Carcinogenic and mutagenic substances shall not be used, if not absolutely necessary\b0 .\line \line \line \line \line Where it is possible, it is compulsory to replace those chemical products which are labelled with\line \line \line 	R45: May cause cancer\line 	H350: May cause cancer\line 	R49: May cause cancer by inhalation\line 	R46: May cause heritable genetic damage\line 	H340: May cause genetic defects\line 	H360: May damage fertility or the unborn child\line 	Exception: This does not apply to fuels used in vehicles, engines or heating.\line \line \line \line \b Is it possible to replace the carcinogenic and mutagenic product?\b0 \line \line In order to be able to assess whether it is possible to replace a chemical product which contains carcinogenic and mutagenic substances and there is a need to examine this issue further. Use the method described in the e-tool to investigate this.\line \line \uc0{\u160}\line \line \b Measures\b0 \line \line \line \line If carcinogenic and mutagenic substances cannot be replaced, it can be good to keep documentation on the investigation which shows that it is not technically feasible to use other less hazardous chemical products.\line \line \line \line \line In the event that products containing carcinogenic and mutagenic substances must be used, they shall (if technically possible) be handled in a closed system. Work, including the equipment and working methods are designed so as to create as little air contaminants as possible and so that sprinkling and splashing is prevented.\line \line \line \line \line The air contaminants generated shall be captured as quickly and as effective as possible and as close as possible to the source using process ventilation, e.g. local exhausts.\line \line \line \line \line If there is a risk of contact with skin, personal protective equipment in the form of protective clothing and protective gloves shall be used.\line \line \line \line \line Spillages shall be collected and removed as quickly and as safely as possible. Wastes which may contain such substances must be stored and transported in shock-resistant, sealed and labelled containers.\line \line \line \line \line For work with carcinogenic or reprotoxic substances, it can be good to provide a written working and safety instruction in order to make it very clear what routines need to be followed.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 1.3. Risk assessment\line \line \line \line If carcinogenic and mutagenic substances are present, it is necessary to assess the risks posed by them. The simplest is, of course, if the products can be replaced with other less dangerous products, in which case there is no need for such an extended the risk assessment which must be carried out for these substances. If this is not possible to replaces these, an assessment should be carry out, which shall include:\line \line Where the substances may occur.\line \line What measures are to be taken and how the work is organised in order to secure that only those working with these substances are present in the premises and rooms where these substances are handled\line \line The protective measures\line \line Where personal protection is needed, where it is intended to be used and the type of protective equipment to be used.\line \line How to secure that everything is working fine, such as technical measures, work instructions are complied with and that changes in or deviations that increase the risk of exposure to the substances are detected as early as possible.\line Such assessments shall be documented and the documentation needs to include the points above.\line \line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 1.4. Register of workers exposed to carcinogenic and mutagenic substances\line \line \line \line \b Carcinogenic and mutagenic\b0  substances can cause serious effects that may appear only after a long period of time. In order to facilitate later investigations into the cause of a cancer or a reproductive abnormality register of exposures is required. The employer is responsible for ensuring that there is such a register. The records shall be retained for a period of at least 40 years (calculated from the date on which the exposure ceases).\line \line \line The exposures are to be included in the register\line \line \line When it is known that workers are exposed to concentrations in excess of the existing occupational exposure limit values.\line \line \line When safeguard measures on a temporary basis have not worked or where existing work instructions are not followed, so that workers are exposed to short-term or long-term high exposure.\line \line \line The register shall cover work with substances which are labelled with the hazard statements or risk phrases:\line \line \line 	R45: May cause cancer.\line 	H350: May cause cancer\line 	R49: May cause cancer by inhalation\line 	R46: May cause heritable genetic damage\line 	H340: May cause genetic defects\line \line \line \line The register must also be kept for, among other things, work with:\line \line \line Wood dust from the wood of deciduous trees.\line \line \line Coal soot, coal tar or coal pitch (containing carcinogenic poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs).\line \line \line The register shall include the following information:\line \line \line Name of the worker\line \line \line Work tasks\line \line \line The worker\uc0{\u8217}s exposure (involving any of the risks described above)\line \line \line How high exposure was. This can be given as a meter (measured exposure), the exposure has been measured. In the absence of measurements, the degree of exposure shall be estimated and described. It can be difficult to make reliable assessments of the exposure. Consult a specialist if needed.\line \line \line The frequency with which the worker was exposed.\line \line \line }

\par \pard \ql {\fs24 2. Sensitising substances\line \line \line \line Many chemical products contain sensitising substances. Allergies such as asthma or eczema may develop after contact with sensitizing substances. Allergies are lifelong and those having developed an allergy will for the rest of their life react also after contact with very small quantities of the substance. Therefore it is good to apply the following good practice, in order to reduce the risk of developing an allergy.\line \line \line \b Good practice measures\b0 \line \line It is good to have routines and rules describing:\line \line \line \line 	Where to handle the sensitizing product.\line 	What protective measures should be used in order to reduce the exposure as much as practically possible?\line 	Should personal protective equipment be used? What kind of equipment and when?\line 	How shall equipment and ventilation be maintained and controlled so that workers are not exposed for sensitising substances?\line 	If sensitizing products are handled openly, are there warning signs informing about the risk?\line \line \line \line \b Information about the risks and protective measures\b0 \line \line Those working with sensitising chemical products or supervising such work need to be informed about the risks and how to conduct the work as well as what protective measures to apply in order to avoid exposure to the sensitising substances.\line \line \line }

\par \pard \ql {\fs24 9. Contaminants in the work place air\line \line \line Contaminants in the work place air can be generated in many work process. Please find below some typical examples.\line \line \line All \b combustion processes\b0  will result in the production of a complex mixture of gases, vapours and solids depending on the fuel, the combustion conditions (e.g. temperature, level of oxygen) and control measures adopted to reduce emission of hazardous materials.\line \line One commonly encountered example is diesel exhaust fumes, arising from the combustion of diesel fuel in compression ignition engines. Emissions from diesel engines are complex mixtures of gases, liquids and solids. Many of the individual components have their own specific toxicity, and some have exposure limits assigned to them. Diesel engine exhaust is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) .\line \line Any process or activities that involve\b  heating, cutting or soldering or welding metal\b0  will produce a fume that again will contain a mixture of gases and particulate materials.\line \line \line The composition of welding fume depends on the type of welding process, the composition of the welding rod and the material being welded. The majority of the fume from metal welding is generated by the consumable (welding rod) rather than the substrate being welded. Information on the composition of the fume should be given on the safety data sheet provided with the consumable. Stainless steel, and other specialist alloys containing high levels of chromium, nickel and manganese carry a particularly high risk. Manual metal arc (stick) welding generates more fume than other techniques, such as MIG and TIG welding (metal inert gas, and tungsten inert gas). Although welding is most commonly used to join metals, other materials, such as plastics, are also welded and these processes can also generate toxic fumes which must be controlled.\line \line The physical and chemical composition of aerosols generated from metal cutting depends on the composition of the metal and any products applied to the surface of the metal. High exposures to welding and other metal fumes can cause metal fume fever, which can present itself as non-specific flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills etc.\line \line \line Other processes involving heating materials can lead to generation of process-generated contaminants. One example is Rubber fumes. There is a wide range of different base rubbers, both natural and synthetic, each with a unique chemical structure. In addition, during the production of rubber products, a wide range of varying chemical agents are used as fillers, vulcanising agents, accelerators and inhibitors, antidegradants and antioxidants, plasticisers, etc.\line \line Chemical agents present in rubber fumes may include various volatile agents (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, dimethylbenzenes, diisopropylbenzenes), polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and other agents As is generally the case for process-generated fumes, many of the individual components have their own specific toxicity, and some have exposure limits assigned to them.\line \line \line Many activities within the construction sector, as well as in the mining and quarrying sector, produce \b dusts \b0 which are released into the air. The exact composition of the dust will depend on factors such as: the types of activities; the materials/products that are being used; the materials used in the buildings that are being built, repaired or demolished; or the composition of the ore that is being mined or quarried. Dust generated in these activities often includes some amount of respirable crystalline silica (RCS). Similarly, asbestos exposure in Europe now mainly occurs during the repair, maintenance or demolition of buildings and hence could be considered a process-generated contaminant.\line \line Organic dusts may also be considered to be process-generated contaminants as they are emitted from organic materials that have undergone some degradation, resulting in a release of a complex mixture that can include a range of viable micro-organisms (e.g. fungal spores, bacteria, viruses) and their by-products including toxins, constituents of their cell-walls (e.g. endotoxins and glucans) and parts of living organisms. Exposure to organic dusts can occur in occupations and industry sectors that involve working with animals, plants and organic materials, including farming and collection and processing (e.g. composting) of household and other waste. Other organic contaminants may be released as aerosols, for example during the slaughtering and butchering of animals.\line \line An example of an organic dust is Wood dust, which is generated from sawing, sanding and other woodworking processes, and carries a variety of health risks. This includes the dust from hard and soft woods, and also composite materials such as medium density fibreboard (MDF) and chipboard, wood chippings used for animal litter or in the paper and pulp industry, or mulch made of wood chippings. Wood dust can cause asthma and is also classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a carcinogen[3].\line \line \line IARC has classified several process-generated substances as Group 1 \uc0{\u8211} Carcinogenic to humans (e.g. diesel engine exhaust, coal combustion, soot, and wood dust) and Group 2a \uc0{\u8211} probably carcinogenic to humans (e.g. welding fumes, bitumen, biomass fuel emissions, combustion of coal, gasoline engine exhaust). In addition, several occupations and industries are classified as Group 1 (e.g. rubber industry, painter) or Group 2b (e.g. firefighter, petroleum industry) where the causal agent has not been established, but where the process-generated emissions are likely to play an important role.\line \line \line }

Pregnant and breastfeeding women\line \line \line \line Foetuses and infants are more sensitive to chemical substances than adults. Therefore, it is important that they should not be exposed to hazardous chemical substances.\line \line \line Substances which are especially dangerous for unborn children and infants\line \line Substances which are particularly dangerous for unborn children and infants and pregnant and breastfeeding and therefore should be avoided are:\line \line lead\line \line mercury; mercury compounds\line \line some medicinal products (that is to say, certain cytostatics, cytostatic drugs are used in the healthcare sector)\line \line carbon monoxide (available in flue gases and exhaust gas)\line \line chemical substances, which can be absorbed through the skin effects;\line \line \line Substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction are particularly dangerous to unborn children and infants. These chemical products are labelled with hazard pictogram with any of the following hazard statements (or alternatively orange symbols with risk phrases). Hazard statements are codes for the risks posed by chemical products.

Introduction\line \line \line \line Certain activities and processes imply particular chemical risks that need to be dealt with and controlled. Often, the risks in a sector, a process or for a profession are similar and predictable and can be controlled through applying good practice in a similar manner, regardless of workplace.\line \line On the pages about the different sectors, processes and professions we provide tips and advice on measures to reduce risk and which can be a way to cope with the relevant laws and rules. Applying good practice is a shortcut to controlling chemical risks and reduces the demands for elaborate risk assessments. Applying the good practice is often an easy, fast and effective way of complying with the general regulatory demands for safe handling of chemicals.\uc0{\u160} The good practice includes tips and advice on measures that reduce and control risks.\line \line \line Good practice is described for some common sectors, processes and professions where chemical risks need to be controlled.\line \line \line The good practice mainly corresponds to the EU Directive 98/24/EC on risks related to chemical agents at work, demanding risk identification, assessment and control. This Directive is implemented and sometimes complemented in the national legislation of the member states.\line \line Below is an\uc0{\u160} overview of sectors, processes and professions for which we provide good practice.\line \line There are, of course, many more sectors, processes and professions which may pose risks. For all sectors, processes and professions, the general regulations about risk assessment and measures to control the chemical risks apply. Read more about that under These routines must work. The action to be taken depends on how the risk is assessed.\line \line \line This guide informs on different types of practical measures to reduce chemical risks. There is a comprehensive body of European and national legislation for these and more substances that present specific demands for these as well as other sectors, processes and professions.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 16. Hairdressers\line \line Many products used in hairdressing, such as hair dyes, products for permanent waving and fixatives are irritating to the skin and respiratory tract. These products may also contain products which can cause eczema and allergies.\line \line For products labelled with a hazard pictogram the suppliers needs to provide a safety data sheet, which should be kept as it provides information on the risks as well as the protective measures needed. The protective measures described should be applied. There is no requirement to provide safety data sheets for cosmetic products, still it is useful if the supplier can provide it.\line \line \line Good practice when working with chemical products in hairdressing is:\line \line \line Check that the general ventilation works well in the hairdressing saloon. A very effective way of reducing exposure to air contaminants during perm and dyeing is to use a transparent exhaust hood, placed above the customer\uc0{\u8217}s head.\line \line \line A fume cupboard (ventilated cabinets) can be used when mixing hair dyes. Alternatively, this can be done under an exhaust hood as the one described above.\line \line In order to avoid exposure to dust from bleaching products, the product can be bought in special packaging which do not need to be opened until the mixture is ready. An alternative is to leave the hydrogen peroxide to be absorbed in in the bleaching powder.\line \line Try to replace dangerous products (for information on risks look at the label with pictograms and the safety data sheet) with less dangerous products;\line \line Use metal tools, e.g. metal clips - which do not release nickel (nickel may cause allergies). It is suitable using scissors with plastic coated handles.\line \line Check that there is access to emergency eye-wash, in case of getting dust or splashes of chemical products in the eyes. The easiest way is emergency eye-wash connected to the tap in a wash basin. The eyewash may be complemented by an emergency eye-wash bottle.\line \line Gloves should be worn at all times when dealing with chemical products. It is best to use disposable gloves made of plastic. The gloves must be clean and dry inside. A protective apron can be used when appropriate.\line \line Take care of your skin and hands. Use hand lotion extensively. Avoid wearing rings, watches and wrist-wear since chemical products may remain under them.\line \line Evaluate the risks in hairdressing and take the precautions needed to control the risks. If such measures are not applied, the risks will increase.\line \line }

Asbestos\line \line 3.1.Introduction\line \line \line \line The following applies to all work with asbestos\line \line \line Working with asbestos requires effective measures that reduce the exposure to asbestos, but also notification, training, medical checks and measurements.\line \line If asbestos must be removed, it is simplest to make use of the services of a contractor for the remediation of asbestos. In order to ensure that the contractor complies with the applicable laws and rules for the removal of asbestos, it is good to be clear about the requirements on the contractor. These requirements can be included in the procurement demands and in agreement with the contractor.\line \line \line 3.2. Measures prior to the commencement of work:\line \line \line \line 	Check that you have made the notification needed, that the workers have the training and medical checks required and that the measurements needed for risk assessments are carried out.\line 	Examine which materials containing or likely to contain asbestos.\line 	For demolition \uc0{\u8212} if there is the slightest doubt as to whether asbestos is present, request information on the presence of asbestos in the building to be demolished, the owner or the owner of the technical device (such as machinery).\line 	Specific arrangements and equipment is needed to work with asbestos safely. Work therefore needs to be planned carefully, so that all necessary arrangements are in place when work starts.\line 	It is important to be prepared to protect staff if something unexpected occurs. Assess risks and describe how the work is to be carried out and the protective equipment to be used in safety instructions; the instructions shall be available at the workplace. In demolition processes the instructions needs to be adapted to the situation at the establishment concerned. The written working and safety instructions shall contain the following information on the measures:\line 	how to prevent dust suppression\line 	the need for personal protective equipment\line 	cleaning up after demolition\line 	handling the waste\line 	personal hygiene.\line \line \line \line 3.3. Organising the work\line \line \line \line Organise the work so that as few workers as possible are in contact with and exposed to asbestos.\line \line Plan the work so that there is time to keep the facilities and equipment clean. Clean up dust containing asbestos fibres continuously. If equipment is to be transported to another location for cleaning \uc0{\u8212} put it in sealed packaging before transport.\line \line Smoking is forbidden within the defined area in which asbestos is present.\line \line \line \b Labelling and signage\b0 \line \line Place of work where asbestos is present and concentrations will probably exceed the threshold limit value must be clearly delimited and clearly marked with warning signs, e.g. \uc0{\u8220}Asbestos work \uc0{\u8212} No access of non-authorised persons\uc0{\u8221} or for demolition; \uc0{\u8220}Caution \uc0{\u8212} Demolition \uc0{\u8212} Asbestos \uc0{\u8212} Access prohibited for unauthorised persons\uc0{\u8217}.\line \line Packaging and containers containing asbestos or materials containing asbestos, shall be clearly marked with warnings which must contain the word \uc0{\u8220}asbestos\uc0{\u8221}.\line \line \line 3.4. Respiratory protection\line \line \line \line Breathing protection shall be chosen so that it fits the user (fit is important in order to have a high level of protection).\line \line The only type of respiratory protective equipment providing protection against asbestos are powered and supplied-air respirators. In exceptional cases filter masks may be used but only if the air does not contain high concentrations of asbestos and the work is not be physically demanding.\b  In practice, the situation is almost always that powered and supplied-air respirator is the only option which secures good enough protection against asbestos.\b0 \line \line \line 3.5. Workwear\line \line \line \line Comprehensive and close-fitting protective clothing incorporating a hood shall be used for all activities, with direct contact with asbestos, for instance in the event of demolition and when working with installations which contain asbestos. The protective clothing needs to be dust repelling and designed in such a way that no dust is collected in the fold, pockets or similar.\line \line Work clothing and personal clothing should not be kept together.\line \line Work clothing contaminated by asbestos should not be allowed to be laundered, together with other garments. (Studies show that asbestos workers families also have an increased incidence of diseases related to exposure to asbestos, which is considered to be due to exposure to asbestos in family members working clothes.)\line \line Containers containing the clothes used when working with asbestos must be clearly marked with the words \uc0{\u8216}asbestos contaminated protective clothing\uc0{\u8217}.\line \line \line 3.6. Waste\line \line \line \line Waste, materials, empty packaging, filters and other material containing asbestos, shall immediately be placed in closed containers and stored so until it can be finally disposed of.\line \line \line 3.7. On completion of the work\line \line \line \line Clean up carefully, so that no dust containing asbestos fibres still present on any surfaces.\line \line \line }
\par \pard \ql {\fs24 3.8. Specific practices for demolition work\line \line \line \line Preparation and organisation\line \line As the demolition of asbestos poses specific risks and require that the work and any safety instructions are strictly respected, it would be inappropriate on a piecework basis, which may mean that staff is working under pressure.\line \line If someone is working alone with demolition inside an enclosure, readiness is required in the event of an accident.\line \line During demolition it has to be ensured that there are toilet and showers connected up to hot and cold water readily accessible at the workplace so that it is possible to wash before the meal and take a shower after work.\line \line The demolition should\uc0{\u160} to start with removing the parts containing asbestos. Then proceed with the rest.\line \line \line \b Respiratory protection\b0 \line \line For the demolition of asbestos in enclosed areas breathing protection fitted with are powered and supplied-air respirators shall be used\line \line Breathing protection shall be worn at all times during work in progress in enclosed demolition areas as well as when undressing and taking care of protective clothing.\line \line \line \b Safeguard measures\b0 \line \line It is an advantage if the demolition of loosely fitted asbestos can be carried out using a wet method. The wet process method produces generates a significantly lower exposure than dry stripping.\line \line Machinery used for the demolition must either be fitted with extraction which is integrated into the machine or used in conjunction with local exhaust ventilation, placed as close to the place of processing that they effectively captures the dust which is disseminated.\line \line The demolition area shall be enclosed. For larger demolition works, demolition area may be encapsulated with walls of plastic sheeting. The room must be ventilated and have negative pressure in relation to its surroundings. Will there be a leak the outside air will flow into the work space from the environment and asbestos does not spread from the area to the surroundings. It is good to monitor the difference in pressure. An airlock shall be provided for the access to and exit from the enclosure. In the airlock the workers must be able to wash their hands when finalising the work and taking off protective clothing.\line \line \b ATTENTION!\b0  At demolition work many details have to be kept in mind not to run the risk of inhaling asbestos.\line \line \b Clothing shall be carried out in the airlock, not outside\b0 . If changing clothes outside the airlock, that room will be contaminated with asbestos. And in addition, the worker taking off the clothes outside the air lock will be exposed to asbestos\line \line \b All material in the enclosure which have been exposed to asbestos, must be discarded after completion of the work (waste containing asbestos)\b0 . If using joists when constructing encapsulations with plastic walls, it is good to put the joists on the outside in order not to contaminate them with asbestos.\line \line \b Airlock\b0 . The lock in which clothes are exchanged must be designed and used in such a way that it is not open at both ends at the same time. Materials that are contaminated with asbestos must be packed before it is transported out of the airlock.\line \line \line When working with very\b  limited demolition tasks\b0 , it can be good to use a technique with glove-boxes. The area where the asbestos is to be removed in encapsulated and in the encapsulation two gloves are mounted. The worker is placed outside the encapsulation and doing the job using the gloves. Also glove-boxes need to be put under low pressure, which can be measured with a differential pressure meter.\line \line \line If a vacuum cleaner or local exhausts are used to capture and remove material with asbestos or air contaminated with asbestos, the exhaust air should be emitted outside the premises. The equipment should be equipped with effective filters to capture the asbestos. The filters need to be exchanged and treated as waste containing asbestos.\line \line \line \b Workwear\b0 \line \line Each time you leave an enclosed demolition area protective clothing needs to be vacuum cleaned and taken off in the airlock. This shall be done before removal of the respiratory protective equipment. Other garments may not be taken into the airlock.\line \line Working clothes to be reused are placed in a special bag.\line \line \line \b Waste\b0 \line \line All materials from the demolition as asbestos waste shall be placed in closed containers. Such materials may not be re-used. That is why it is good to place joists on the outside of the plastic enclosure.\line \line \line \b On completion of the work\b0 \line \line After demolition, it is good practice to ventilate at least 4-12 hours after the completion of work, before the demolition of walls and airlock.\line \line During handling and transport the ventilators, it is good practice to cover the air intake to the ventilators with plastics, in order to prevent spreading of asbestos when the ventilators are handled and transported.\line \line Dust containing asbestos fibers can often be left on plastic sheets used for the encapsulation. Vacuum cleaning\uc0{\u160} and/or moistening of the plastic surfaces reduces the emission of asbestos when the encapsulation is demolished.,\line \line Cleaning of tools or placing them in a plastic bag which is sealed before transportation is good pr4qactice that reduces the emission of asbestos from contaminated tools.\line \line \line }
